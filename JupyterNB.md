# Multi-agent Collaboration for Financial Analysis¶
We will learn ways for making agents collaborate with each other.
The libraries are already installed in the classroom. If you're running this notebook on your own machine, you can install the following:
`!pip install crewai==0.28.8 crewai_tools==0.1.6 langchain_community==0.0.29`
`# Warning control
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')`

Import libraries, APIs and LLM
`from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew`

Note:

The video uses gpt-4-turbo, but due to certain constraints, and in order to offer this course for free to everyone, the code you'll run here will use gpt-3.5-turbo.
You can use gpt-4-turbo when you run the notebook locally (using gpt-4-turbo will not work on the platform)
Thank you for your understanding!

# Creating the Crew
The Process class helps to delegate the workflow to the Agents (kind of like a Manager at work)
In the example below, it will run this hierarchically.
manager_llm lets you choose the "manager" LLM you want to use.

`from crewai import Crew, Process
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Define the crew with agents and tasks
financial_trading_crew = Crew(
    agents=[data_analyst_agent, 
            trading_strategy_agent, 
            execution_agent, 
            risk_management_agent],
    
    tasks=[data_analysis_task, 
           strategy_development_task, 
           execution_planning_task, 
           risk_assessment_task],
    
    manager_llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", 
                           temperature=0.7),
    process=Process.hierarchical,
    verbose=True
)`
